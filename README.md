Big data is just marketing hyper, so is cloud computing, which is rather a business model renovation instead of technology innovation

The paradigm of Internet is shifting: from information to knowledge, from knowledge to intelligence; the paradigm of web is shifting: from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, from Web 2.0 to Live (Real-time)Web, from blocking I/O to event queue; the paradigm of computing is shifting: from procedural to object-oriented, from object-oriented to object-functional, and from discrete to continuous; the paradigm of algorithm is shifting: from algorithm design to algorithm configuration, from algorithm configuration to algorithm generation; the paradigm of data is shifting: from small to big; from weak to strong; from relational (SQL) to non-relational (NoSQL), new-relational (NewSQL) and in-memory DB, from structured to unstructured and semi-structured; the paradigm of data structure is shifting from custom to semi-custom and generic; the paradigm of communication is shifting: from person to person to person to machine, from person to machine to machine to machine (M2M or Internet of Things); the paradigm of reasoning is shifting: from offline to online and near-line as the demands of real-time execution becomes main stream. Last but not the least, the paradigm of business model is shifting: from product to service, from service to self-service. Business virtualization and life virtualization are not dreams any more

This meetup addresses frontier technology and innovative business model in Real-time Big Velocity Stream Computing
